# Molten
The official proxy of Titanium Network, still being worked on.

# Why you shouldn't use it
This proxy isn't done or stable yet. Changes to the structure of the project happen daily and this could cause problems with users.

# What isn't done
* WebRTC
* Proxy object masking
* Security policy emulation

# Future optimizations
* Asyncronization
* Cache
* Faster alernative for sending data to the client
* Ad/Spyware blockers
